# Guidelines 

## Instructions 
Conference abstracts: Authors are invited to submit short papers of length up to 3 pages excluding references (1 column – the LNCS template) showing proof-of-concept research contributions under the topics of the conference. 
All submissions will be peer-reviewed and accepted articles will be published as MIUA Abstract Proceedings on the MIUA website.

The abstract paper submission deadline will be 23:59, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), on 31st May 2021.

### Length of Papers
The most common types of papers accepted for publication are full papers (12–15+
pages) and short papers (6-11 pages), where a page constitutes 300-400 words. We
only wish to publish papers of significant scientific content. Very short papers (of
fewer than 4 pages) may be moved to the back matter. Such papers will neither be
available for indexing nor visible as individual papers on SpringerLink. They will,
however, be listed in the Table of Contents.
