## notes

"Training GANs can be tricky. Since learning involves two opposing net-
works, GANs are known for suffering from several training problems, the
following three being among the most widely documented."
* Convergence.
* Vanishing Gradients.
* Mode Collapse.


3.3. GAN Training Tricks
* Label smoothing.
* Feature matching.
* Differentiable augmentation.
